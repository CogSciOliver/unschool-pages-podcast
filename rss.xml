			<title><![CDATA[Tornado Tales: Sheltering in Place and Staying Safe]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Signs of a tornado appear, and the KIDO Family gets ready to shelter in place. There’s no panic, but hints of stress and wonder are in the air. The children ask their mommy if they’re safe from nature’s might or if they’ll come face to face with a tornado tonight.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve noticed storms gathering force, making us suspect someone, somewhere, is giving Earth a makeover this year. We’ve experienced weather like never before: snowstorms, earthquakes, wildfires, hail, mud from heavy rains, and dust from harmattans. Flooding in some places, tornadoes blowing others away.</p>
<p>But today, things got real! A wall of clouds covered our nature view, and our phone alarms wailed. We gathered our boots to bring you the story about being tornado-proof.</p>
<p>In this episode, we discuss what we’ve learned about tornadoes, sheltering in place, the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and following storm chaser trails. We’re safe, with our shoes, sweaters, and some games, sitting in the closet, sharing the knowledge we’ve gained.</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Crawfish or Crayfish? It’s Mardi Gras season and we’re headed to the Bayous and swampland biomes of Louisiana to uncover the animals that live within the low-lying marshy, wetland creeks —where fish and plankton thrive! We discover the Ankylosaurus survived to become Alligator Snapping Turtles. We visit the kings of this planet genus Panthera, paying respect to their apex-ness. We uncover boars, eagles, swamp rats and red belly piranha. When we started the journey we knew there were frogs. But Dino Robot thought all there was were small creatures. Wow, were they in for a surprise! Join us on this wild ride as we uncover the mysteries of the swamp biomes of earth and what humans might taste like to an alligator from Miss Animalia? All this and more on this Swamp Biomes Unearthed - A Mardi Gras Wildlife Adventure episode of Unschool Pages of Our Lives. </p>

			<title><![CDATA[Minecraft Discovery Engagement Week!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Today we have a very different episode from anything that we&#39;ve done in the past. It&#39;s not reading day and we&#39;re not necessarily going to go into our new podcast segment structure. We&#39;re just going to explore Minecraft today. It&#39;s gaming week here at the KIDO Family Ranch, and we&#39;ve decided the game that we&#39;re going to play Minecraft, because it will allow me to be creative and build things, as well as have a little bit of struggle in the survival mode. Coming up next the kids are going to teach me how to play Minecraft!</p>

			<description><![CDATA[Amber Brown has come up with a fantastic costume, but it's a secret. She won't even tell Justin, no matter what he bribes her with.
But one thing worries Amber all day. Her parents had a fight before school.  What if they don't make up before their traditional Halloween dinner (macaroni and cheese, carrots, and orange juice)?  What if they are in bad moods during trick-or-treating?  Halloween is one of Amber's favorite holidays, and of course, this one turns out to be as wonderful as all the rest.

As we dive into our ambitious plans for iconic characters like Poison Ivy, glitched-out Corrupted Sims, Darth Vader, and the enigmatic Darth Daddyous, each step becomes a lesson in creativity and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>Journey through discussions on crafting the perfect plumbob, strategizing Darth Vader&#39;s cape dynamics, and the existential costume crisis of Darth Daddyous. Does he opt for a frightening glowing mask or character makeup? Or will he immerse himself in the lore as a unique Sith Lord? The adventure doesn&#39;t stop there; we&#39;re also looking back at our DIY hall of fame featuring Baby Batman and her parents Harley Quinn &amp; The Joker Miss Frizzle &amp; Curious George and the time Darth Daddyous was Clark Kent, no no superman just geeky Clark Kent, and more!</p>
<p>Plus When the realization hits that we&#39;re out of batteries, it&#39;s all hands on deck to innovate a solution for our Sim&#39;s shining plumbob. This episode is more than a costume-making saga; it&#39;s a testament to the unschooling spirit. We&#39;re not just making outfits; we&#39;re engineering dreams, designing realities, and sewing the very fabric of our imagination. Get ready for a tale of exact-o knives, hot glue, grit, and glitter! </p>
